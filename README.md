# Python Coding Practice

## Description

I wanted to brush up on python and data structures & algorithms and decided to write some practice code as a means of keeping my hand in while reviewing my school notes & supplementary online material.

A lot of these implementations are common solutions online & I do not claim full ownership of any of this code, in notes I may have indicated if I copied over from other authors but because this was for the purposes of learning only I cannot guarantee proper citation in every instance.

I just figured it would be nice to have a compiled set of some of the practice work I did on GH in the event that I somehow lose them locally.
